## Animals

For example, the [[Rules/Source/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm\|Panther]] stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [[Rules/Source/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm\|Giant Goat]] stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.
