## Planetar

*Righteously Wrathful Angelic Warrior*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Upper Planes)  
- **Treasure.** [[Rules/Source/tables/random-magic-items-relics\|Relics]]  

Planetars deliver the punishment of righteous gods. These angels innately know truth from lies, and they use magic and blessed weapons to protect the just and root out wickedness across the Multiverse.

These angels act where they can against overwhelming evil, but to avoid the attention of the Lower Planes, they prefer to let mortals attend to affairs on the Material Plane. Planetars often choose mortal champions to oppose threats they're loath to face directly, involving themselves only if necessary. Roll on or choose a result from the Planetar Quests table to inspire what evil a planetar might recruit heroes to thwart.
