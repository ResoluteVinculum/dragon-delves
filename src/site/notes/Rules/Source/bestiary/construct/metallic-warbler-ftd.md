# [Metallic Warbler](Rules\Source\bestiary\construct/metallic-warbler-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 210*  

Metallic warblers resemble songbirds and serve as clandestine agents of their creators, keeping watch over communities without directly intervening. Their telepathic bond lets them summon their dragon creators in case of dire need.

## Metallic Sentinels

A metallic sentinel is a guardian created by a metallic dragon, forged from the metal associated with its creator and powered by the energy of the dragon's breath. An artificial being sculpted in elegant filigree, it is dedicated to defusing tensions that could spiral into violence.
