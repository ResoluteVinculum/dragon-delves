## Imp

*Devil of Pettiness and Suspicion*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** None  

Known for their cowardice and toadying, imps serve devils and wicked magic-users. Their abilities to shape-shift and pass unseen make them skillful spies and adept at fleeing danger. Imps sent to surveil other creatures relate what they discover to their masters, but they frequently omit important details or cast events in the worst possible light to mislead their masters into following the imps' devilish council.

Imps without masters delight in manipulating other creatures and inflating their own egos. They might take over bands of weaker monsters, or they might pose as helpful spirits and trick influential individuals into pursuing nefarious ends.

# [Pseudodragon](Rules\Source\bestiary\dragon/pseudodragon-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 249, Player's Handbook (2024) p. 354. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

## Pseudodragon

*Fickle, Pint-Sized Dragon*

- **Habitat.** Coastal, Desert, Forest, Hill, Mountain, Urban  
- **Treasure.** [[Rules/Source/tables/random-magic-items-arcana\|Arcana]]  

Pseudodragons dwell in scenic wildernesses, preferably where life is easy and prey is small and slow. There they behave like contented wyrms, creating tiny lairs amid ancient trees and rugged cliffs. They fill these lairs with shiny rocks, colorful shells, and unattended treasures that catch their attention, and they guard these hoards fiercely.

Pseudodragons grow to the size of large house cats, and most have red-brown scales. Some have scales with other hues or patterns—markings distinct from those of their larger draconic cousins.

Many magic-users attempt to befriend pseudodragons, hoping to enlist them as familiars. The creatures' intellect and resistance to magic make them excellent companions, and they're considered status symbols in some spellcasting circles.

Many pseudodragons prefer the finer things in life. These diminutive dragons might be inclined to aid those who ply them with treats. Contrariwise, mages who don't properly pamper their pseudo dragon familiars might be abandoned without warning. Roll on or choose an option from the Pseudo dragon Treats table to inspire a pseudodragon's taste in gifts.

**Pseudodragon Treats**

| dice: 1d10 | The Pseudodragon Wants... |
|------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | Flamboyant accessories it can wear. |
| 2 | Mementos from a lost friend or master. |
| 3 | Outlandish delicacies—like axe beak-egg omelets or mammoth-milk cheese. |
| 4 | The possessions of a sibling, rival, or master. |
| 5 | Shiny gifts, from gems to abalone shells. |
| 6 | Soft bedding and stuffed toys. |
| 7 | A specific cook's signature dessert. |
| 8 | Time-consuming beauty treatments. |
| 9 | To hear a bedtime story or favorite song. |
| 10 | Trophies and important-sounding titles. |
> [!quote] A quote from Jallarzi, Pseudodragon's Companion  
> 
> If you want to keep a pseudodragon happy, get used to thinking of yourself as its familiar.

# [Quasit](Rules\Source\bestiary\fiend/quasit-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 252, Player's Handbook (2024) p. 355. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

## Quasit

*Demon of Discord and Disorder*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** None  

Tirelessly destructive, quasits sow discord through nasty pranks, sabotage, and ambushes. These tiny demons use chaos and violence to terrorize others. By shape-shifting into harmless but ill-omened creatures or by turning [[Rules/Source/conditions#Invisible\|invisible]], quasits sneak into places where they spy for villainous masters or set vicious traps. Quasits delight in hiding in dark places and—when least expected—bursting forth to slash foes with their [[Rules/Source/conditions#Poisoned\|poisoned]] claws.

Quasits are usually overlooked and underestimated by other demons. This drives them to prove themselves through cruel acts or by seeking paths to the Material Plane. Among mortals, quasits sow senseless chaos, and they might find kindred evil spirits among violent cultists and magic-users.

# [Skeleton](Rules\Source\bestiary\undead/skeleton-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 282, Player's Handbook (2024) p. 356. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Skeletons are reanimated Humanoid bones bearing the equipment they had in life. They have rudimentary faculties and greater agility than zombies and similar shambling corpses. While they aren't capable of creating plans of their own, they avoid obvious barriers and self-destructive situations.

## Skeletons

*Ossified Evil*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Skeletons rise at the summons of necromancers and foul spirits. Whether they're the remains of the ancient dead or fresh bones bound to morbid ambitions, they commit deathless work for whatever forces reanimated them, often serving as guardians, soldiers, or laborers. In rare cases, skeletons are reanimated but given no particular direction. Roll on or choose a result from the Skeleton Pantomimes table to inspire how undirected skeletons behave.

**Skeleton Pantomimes**

# Slaad Tadpole

</div>



# [Slaad Tadpole](Rules\Source\bestiary\aberration/slaad-tadpole-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 284, Player's Handbook (2024) p. 357. Available in the Free Rules (2024)*  

Slaad tadpoles are ravenous, newborn slaadi. They hatch from eggs implanted into living hosts by red slaadi, but they also appear in great numbers in Limbo and other chaotic realms. Under most conditions, a slaad tadpole transforms into a blue slaad—or a green slaad if its host was able to cast spells of level 3 or higher—within `2d12` hours of hatching.

## Slaadi

*Chaos-Spawned Hordes of Limbo*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Limbo)  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Unpredictable slaadi devour and multiply across the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo. These toad-like, extraplanar beings embody the endless potentiality of their home plane of existence. While slaadi aren't inherently evil, their impulses are wild and often destructive. Many are driven to propagate through supernatural processes. Unfortunately, these processes typically are fatal for other creatures.

Slaadi have no formal society. Rather, strong slaadi dominate weaker ones. Blue and red slaadi rampage across Limbo and spill into other worlds at the direction of green slaadi. More powerful slaadi have connections to the Spawning Stone, a source of chaotic magic from which the first slaadi originated. The Spawning Stone is hidden deep within Limbo, and legends tie its origins to the modron overlord Primus or the ruinous slaad lords, such as Ssendam, the golden amoeboid terror, and Ygorl, the winged skeleton. These slaad lords and others plot to spread slaadi across the multiverse.

> [!note] Slaad Control Gems
> 
> A slaad born from the Spawning Stone has a magical control gem embedded in its head. If a creature claims the gem, the slaad has the [[Rules/Source/conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] condition and obeys the gem's bearer. The slaad ceases to be [[Rules/Source/conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] if it is harmed by the gem's bearer or the bearer's allies or if the gem is returned to the slaad. A [[Rules/Source/spells/greater-restoration-xphb\|Greater Restoration]] spell cast on a slaad destroys the gem, and the slaad ceases to be [[Rules/Source/conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]].
> 
> One can obtain a slaad's control gem using a [[Rules/Source/spells/wish-xphb\|Wish]] or [[Rules/Source/spells/imprisonment-xphb\|Imprisonment]] spell. If the slaad fails its saving throw against [[Rules/Source/spells/imprisonment-xphb\|Imprisonment]], the caster gains the gem, and the slaad isn't imprisoned. An [[Rules/Source/conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] slaad's control gem can be removed by spending 1 minute and succeeding on a DC 20 Wisdom ([[Rules/Source/skills#Medicine\|Medicine]]) check. Failing this check deals 22 (`4d10`) Piercing damage to the slaad.
> [!quote] A quote from Jebeel Sloom  
> 
> Fight a slaad and lose, the story's over. Fight a slaad and win, there's a thousand more standing in line just to prove they're tougher.

*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 291, Player's Handbook (2024) p. 357. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

A sphinx of wonder is brightly feathered and the size of a lion cub. One comes into being every time a unique idea is conceived on the Material Plane. Each sphinx of wonder is fascinated by a particular type of story or field of study, and it learns all it can about that topic. It bears a unique sigil on its forehead that suggests the type of knowledge that fascinates it. Sometimes, a sphinx of wonder forms a bond with a mortal scholar and aids them in their research.

## Sphinxes

*Collectors and Keepers of Secrets*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Planar (Upper Planes)  
- **Treasure.** [[Rules/Source/tables/random-magic-items-arcana\|Arcana]]  

Sphinxes protect the secrets of the multiverse. Formed from the spirits of sages and explorers, sphinxes know the power of truth and the importance of preserving it. They share their wisdom only with those who prove themselves wise or overcome tests of worthiness, such as riddles or battles with dangerous beasts. Through their existences, sphinxes might change form as they gain more nuanced understanding of cosmic enigmas.

### Sphinx Lairs

Sphinxes typically dwell in places that hold great knowledge or prophetic magic.

## Sprite

*Elusive Defender of Fey Realms*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Planar (Feywild)  
- **Treasure.** [[Rules/Source/tables/random-magic-items-armaments\|Armaments]]  

Sprites dwell in mystical forests touched by the magic of the Feywild, living peacefully with most other Fey and friends of nature. These foot-tall spirits of nature resemble elves with exaggerated, whimsical features and gossamer wings.

Sprites can sense the innate goodness or wickedness of other creatures. Those that enter their realms with good intentions might be treated to tiny feasts and celebrations. The wicked face nasty tricks and bold ambushes at the hands of [[Rules/Source/conditions#Invisible\|invisible]] sprite defenders. These woodland guardians enchant the arrows of their tiny bows with charming magic that can pierce the heart of the fiercest foe.

Sprites oppose any creatures that seek to harm places of natural magic and beauty. This can put them into conflict with would-be settlers, monsters like ettercaps, and despoilers such as goblinoids and hags. They frequently aid other good creatures of the forest, including treants and unicorns, in defending their homes.

## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [[Rules/Source/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm\|Panther]] stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [[Rules/Source/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm\|Giant Goat]] stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

# [Zombie](Rules\Source\bestiary\undead/zombie-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 346, Player's Handbook (2024) p. 359. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Humanoid zombies usually serve as guardians, servants, or soldiers for evil magic-users. In rare cases, foul magic might result in widespread reanimation of the dead, unleashing hordes of zombies to terrorize the living.

## Zombies

*Relentless Reanimated Corpses*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Zombies are unthinking, reanimated corpses, often gruesomely marred by decay and lethal traumas. They serve whatever supernatural force animates them—typically evil necromancers or fiendish spirits. Zombies are relentless, merciless, and resilient, and their dead flesh can carry on even after suffering grievous wounds. While they can follow simple orders, they rely on primal drives rather than thought. They fulfill commands by working tirelessly or battering through foes, but they are easily stymied by barriers or unexpected circumstances.

Zombies are usually created from Humanoid corpses, but the remains of other creatures can also become zombies. Such monstrous zombies might possess the strength they had in life or a measure of their supernatural abilities, but they employ such abilities haphazardly at best.
